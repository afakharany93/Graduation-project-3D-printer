/* some hints for usage:
The Arduino has 3Timers and 6 PWM output pins. The relation between timers and PWM outputs is:

Pins 5 and 6: controlled by timer0
Pins 9 and 10: controlled by timer1
Pins 11 and 3: controlled by timer2

On the Arduino Mega we have 6 timers and 15 PWM outputs:

Pins 4 and 13: controlled by timer0
Pins 11 and 12: controlled by timer1
Pins 9 and 10: controlled by timer2
Pin 2, 3 and 5: controlled by timer 3
Pin 6, 7 and 8: controlled by timer 4
Pin 46, 45 and 44:: controlled by timer 5
